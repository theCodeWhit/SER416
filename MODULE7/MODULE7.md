# PROJECT SCHEDULE (TIME) MANAGEMENT
>12 MIN
steps involved in developing initial plan
- scope: charter -> Scope -> UML UC -> Requirements -> WBS
- Schedule: WBS -> Gantt, Network Analysis

You need to know what features you are going to have in order to make your gantt chart. 
- you will usually have an end date that is not negotiable 
- The schedule is usually the most important 

ELEMENTS OF A SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN 
its about the tools and how you plan to manage the schedule 

> a milestone is a significant event that normally has 0 duration
>   it often takes several activities 

Effort and duration 
effort might take 2 weeks but it might take 3 weeks to complete. 
effort does not help you in your schedule
you have to account for holidays and vacations, especially if it is the end of the year. 

# DEVELOPING THE SCHEDULE 
> 9 MIN

Set up initial schedule from WBS and perhaps initial cut during scope activities

The whole point is to have realistic timeframe of when the project will be complete
Things do not always start right after the previous stage is finished, sometimes there are buffers.</br>
#### IMPORTANT TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
~~~
Gantt Charts
Critical Path Analysis 
Critical chain scheduling
PERT analysis 
~~~
#### ESTIMATING ACTIVITY DURATIONS
- Duration includes the actual amount of time worked on an activity plus elapsed time
- People doing the work should help create / confirm estimates
- A three-point estimate is a way of giving a range that includes an optimistic, most likely and pestimistic estimate
- Network and PERT -Best early for birds-eye view 
</br>
Use common practices and tools to show the schedule </br>

-  Diamonds: milestones
- Thick Lines: Duration of tasks
- Arrows: Dependencies

Dont forget to update the WBS dictionary after making your Gantt Chart

#### ADDING MILESTONES TO GANTT CHARTS
Many people like to focus on meeting miletsones, especially for large projects
- Milestones emphasize important events or accomplishments on projects 
- helps to see if it is on track or not
~~~
SMART CRITERIA FOR MILESTONES
- Specific 
- Measurable
- Assignable
- Realistic
- Time-framed
