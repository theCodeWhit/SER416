#### THE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT 


Research shows a need to improve project risk management 

- Anticipate/avoid problems
- Prevent surprises
- Improve ability to negotiate 
- meet customer committments 
- Reduce schedule slips
- Reduce cost overruns

A dictionary definition is the possibility of loss or injury. General definition of project risk: an uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives.

Managing negative risks involves a number of possible actions that project managers can take to: 
- avoid 
- lessen 
- change
- or accept the potential effects of risks on their projects

Positive risk management is like investing in opportunities 

#### BEST PRACTICE
Some organizations make the mistake of only addressing tactical and negative risk when performing project risk management 
* Integrated Risk Management: widening the scope of risk management to include both strategic and upside opportunities 
COVID for example is an important risk that no one saw coming. 


Possible Positive Risk 
-The field of your studies is in more demand therefore salaries are up 
- Getting a masters degree



## RISK UTILITY 
> 12 mins

Risk utility is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received form a potential payoff (~negative risk is neutralized)
* Utility rises at a decreasing rate for people who are risk-adverse
* Those who are risk-seeking have a higher tolerance for risk and their satisfaction increases when more payoff is at stake
* Risk-neautral approach achieves a balance between risk and payoff
* You also have to make the assumption that risk goes up with the potential payoff
* Risk is also time-dependent and situation/environment dependent
