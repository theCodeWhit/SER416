#### What is cost? 
> A resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange 
It is usually measured in monetary untis like dollars that must be paid to acquire goods and services. Other cost is lost compute time, lab space etc.

Opportunity cost - the loss of  potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. 

When referring to loss, it isnt always about money, it can be other things as well. 

#### The importance of Project Cost Management

* IT projects have a poor track record for meeting budget goals. 
  * Cost overrun --> additional percentage (or dollar amount) by which actual costs exceed estimates. 
  * There is an average cost overrun of 27% according to Harvard study
    * The most important finding was the large number of gigantic overages or "black swans"; a high-impact event that is rare and unpredictable, but not imporbable in retrospect (aka they should have realized the risk was higher than they thought)

You cannot monitor all of your risks but if you have something that is high impact with low probability you could have some problems.

#### MORAL OF THE STORY 
you have a plan A and a plan B but what ends up happening is plan ADAPT -you have to adapt as you go.
