#### WHAT IS COST? 
> A resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange 
It is usually measured in monetary untis like dollars that must be paid to acquire goods and services. Other cost is lost compute time, lab space etc. 
</br>
Opportunity cost - the loss of  potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. 

When referring to loss, it isnt always about money, it can be other things as well. 

#### The importance of Project Cost Management

* IT projects have a poor track record for meeting budget goals. 
  * Cost overrun --> additional percentage (or dollar amount) by which actual costs exceed estimates. 
  * There is an average cost overrun of 27% according to Harvard study
    * The most important finding was the large number of gigantic overages or "black swans"; a high-impact event that is rare and unpredictable, but not imporbable in retrospect (aka they should have realized the risk was higher than they thought)

You cannot monitor all of your risks but if you have something that is high impact with low probability you could have some problems.

#### MORAL OF THE STORY 
you have a plan A and a plan B but what ends up happening is plan ADAPT -you have to adapt as you go. 

#### WHAT IS PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT?
1. Planning 
2. Estimating Cost
3. Determining the budget
4. Controlling costs 

**True** actual cost is hard to come by -accuracy vs percision
* IT differs from core business 
  * IT will be more formal but its core may be more relaxed 
  * Seriousness also depends on size of company as well 

Depending on your company, project cost can be quite complex and may be done at the division level. 

~~~
Planning: determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling cost

Estimating: Developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to to complete a project 

Determinging Budget: Allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance

Controlling Cost: Controlling changes to the project budget
~~~

#### BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COST MANAGEMENT

#### ROI: RETURN ON INVESTMENT 
* You cannot measure ROI unless you have a "benefit" ($ may not be only consideration) measurement process in place
  * The return/benifit of the project can be defined many ways
  * E.g. a benefit could be market leadership
  * if not done well, success will be elusive
  * it is also important to predict and validate the benefit and improve over time
  * Useful to decide between multiple projects when you cant do them all 

#### PROJECT SELECTION

Risk level and probability should be considered when weighting.

usually should not consider sunk cost in your determination

## PLANNING COST MANAGEMENT AND ESTIMATING COSTS
> 16 MIN
The first step in project cost management is planning how the costs will be managed throughout the life of the project

Estimating Cost </br>
PMs should take cost estimates seriously if they want to complete projects within budget contraints. Ensure everyone is estimating it the same way.

The number of cost estimates vary by application area
* the association for the advancement of cost engineering international identifies five types of cost estimates for construction project. 
* --Order of magnitude, conceptual, preliminary, definitive, and control 
* Estimates are usually done at various stages of a project and should become more accurate as time progresses with experience
* It is important to provide supporting details including assumptions
