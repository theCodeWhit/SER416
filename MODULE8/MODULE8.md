#### WHAT IS COST? 
> A resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange 
It is usually measured in monetary untis like dollars that must be paid to acquire goods and services. Other cost is lost compute time, lab space etc. 
</br>
Opportunity cost - the loss of  potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. 

When referring to loss, it isnt always about money, it can be other things as well. 

#### The importance of Project Cost Management

* IT projects have a poor track record for meeting budget goals. 
  * Cost overrun --> additional percentage (or dollar amount) by which actual costs exceed estimates. 
  * There is an average cost overrun of 27% according to Harvard study
    * The most important finding was the large number of gigantic overages or "black swans"; a high-impact event that is rare and unpredictable, but not imporbable in retrospect (aka they should have realized the risk was higher than they thought)

You cannot monitor all of your risks but if you have something that is high impact with low probability you could have some problems. 
</br>
#### MORAL OF THE STORY 
you have a plan A and a plan B but what ends up happening is plan ADAPT -you have to adapt as you go. 

#### WHAT IS PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT?
1. Planning 
2. Estimating Cost
3. Determining the budget
4. Controlling costs 

**True** actual cost is hard to come by -accuracy vs percision
* IT differs from core business 
  * IT will be more formal but its core may be more relaxed 
  * Seriousness also depends on size of company as well 

Depending on your company, project cost can be quite complex and may be done at the division level. 

~~~
Planning: determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling cost

Estimating: Developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to to complete a project 

Determinging Budget: Allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance

Controlling Cost: Controlling changes to the project budget
~~~

#### BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COST MANAGEMENT

#### ROI: RETURN ON INVESTMENT 
* You cannot measure ROI unless you have a "benefit" ($ may not be only consideration) measurement process in place
  * The return/benifit of the project can be defined many ways
  * E.g. a benefit could be market leadership
  * if not done well, success will be elusive
  * it is also important to predict and validate the benefit and improve over time
  * Useful to decide between multiple projects when you cant do them all 

#### PROJECT SELECTION

Risk level and probability should be considered when weighting.

usually should not consider sunk cost in your determination

## PLANNING COST MANAGEMENT AND ESTIMATING COSTS
> 16 MIN
The first step in project cost management is planning how the costs will be managed throughout the life of the project

Estimating Cost </br>
PMs should take cost estimates seriously if they want to complete projects within budget contraints. Ensure everyone is estimating it the same way.

The number of cost estimates vary by application area
* the association for the advancement of cost engineering international identifies five types of cost estimates for construction project. 
* --Order of magnitude, conceptual, preliminary, definitive, and control 
* Estimates are usually done at various stages of a project and should become more accurate as time progresses with experience
* It is important to provide supporting details including assumptions

#### TYPICAL PROBLEMS WITH IT COST ESTIMATES
Reasons for inaccuracies
- Estimates are done too quickly / limited thought
- People lack estimating experience
- Human beings are biased toward underestimating 
- Management lacking desire for accuracy (perhaps not a part of the culture) 
- you will have noisy data so remember your precision level 

### HOW TO DEVELOP A COST ESTIMATE AND BASIS OF ESTIMATES
- Do your homework first 
- Look for best known practices
- Accepted methodologies if known 
- Labor cost charts 
- Talk to finance folks for labor cost 
- **consider inflation for long term projects

Function point estimates business functionality and measure software size. 

### BEST PRACTICE
"Cost Estimating in an Agile Developement Environment" -2015 Alvin Alexander 
* Function points are a means of measuring software size in terms that are meaningful to end users
* User stories are a common way to describe requirements in a simple, concise way. 
* Developers can analyze user stories to estimate the number of internal logical files (ILFs) 


## BUDGET CONTROL COST, EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT 
> 23 MIN
Determining the budget 
* Budget is not just the as total cost: it is how you allocate the project total cost estimate to individual work items (WBS) over time. 
* Important goal is to produce a cost baseline: you can track to see if you are on track or behind in terms of cost vs baseline.

You have to evaluate the progress made on your project and not just focus on the time. </br>
Usually a company has to make 3 times your salary to justify your expense because they have to pay for benefits and 401K
</br>

#### CONTROLLING COST 
* Activities involved in controlling project cost
  * Monitoring cost performance
  * Ensurancing that only appropriate project changes are included in a revised cost baseline
  * Informing project stakeholders of authorized changes to the project that will affect cost 
  * Ivestigate any significant deviations --ensure no scope creep, misunderstood requirements etc. 
* Several tools and techniques assist in project cost control 
  * Expert judgment, data analysis, project management information 
* Some companies will have their own tools that each manager assigns their team to company wide projects 
  * Roll up can be used for budgeting 
  * finance folks may be able to help get you reports / set up page for you

#### EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT 
* Much of this is not in the book 
* Project performance measurement technique that integrates scope, time and cost data 
* Earned value manageement ivolves calculating three values for each activity or summary activity from a project's WBS each period
 * Planned Value -- What you plan on spending on a given task 
 * Actual Cost -- What you have spent so far on a given taks 
 * Earned Value -- is the % of total budget actually completed (can also be a $)

Example: When assessing earned value, lets assume you plan to get $8K amount of work done, did you actually complete all the tasks during that period? or were only half of them completed (aka $4K amount of work) at the cost of $8k --in this case you are over cost and behind schedule. This would make your earned value (EV) $4K. Earned value can never increased for a task because that would require more work.

* Planned Value (PV) -- You have this from the get-go, you may revise/update it
* Actual Cost (AC) -- You get that from the team (how many hours/dollars you spend per period) 
* Earned Value (EV) -- Assessing how much work got done against what was planned. EV = PV of all completed work 
* Cost Variance (CV) -- CV = EV - AC : If the EV is greater than the AC you are ahead of the game. 
* Schedule Variance (SV) -- SV = EV - PV : How much work you have done compared to plan
* Cost Performance Index (CPI) -- CPI = EV/AV : values less than 1 means you are overrunning 
* Schedule Performance Index (SPI) -- EV/PV 
* Budget at Completion (BAC) -- Doesnt change 
* Cost Estimate at Completion (EAC) -- 
* Cost Estimate to Complete (ETC) -- if you were behind in the beginning but everything else goes according to plan, the ETC tells you the estimate to complete the particular CPI 

#### Earned Value Management (EVM)
* Recall EAC = Total Cost at current efficiency to date 
* ETC = Total cost if efficiency moves back to planned efficency 
* But what efficiency do you need to work to be able to meet original cost?
